Capstone project by Amanda, Dustin, Jimmy & Neco | LEARN Academy | 2022

Joint 4ces
Joint 4CES is a web app that connects military veteran business owners and entrepreneurs with the greater veteran-owned business community via the creation and sharing of individual business listings.
Veterans who served together in combined military operations and branches in the past will be reunited and reconnected as part of this project's goals.
